_**DESCRIPTION**:_
This project presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of the **financial performance of Indian banks** during the **FY 2023–2024**.
Using detailed balance sheet data from public sector banks, private sector banks,and small finance banks,
the study examines profitability, efficiency, and structural characteristics of the Indian banking ecosystem.
The core objective of this project is to explore how key financial variables such as deposits, total assets, income, and expenditure
influence the **Net Profit** of banks, and how performances differ across banking sectors. 
The analysis employs **Gamma Regression** from the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework to model skewed financial data, 
supported by diagnostic checks, graphical insights, and efficiency benchmarking.

_**Key Features:**___
1.**Sector-Wise Comparison**: Evaluates performance differences between public, private, and small finance banks.
2.**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes pie charts, bar charts, boxplots, and scatterplots for visual insight.
3.**Statistical Modeling**:Uses Gamma Regression to model Net Profit.Handles skewness using the log-link function.Tests for multicollinearity through GVIF.
4.**Profitability Insights**: Identifies top profit-making banks and correlating factors.
5.**Efficiency Study**: Computes efficiency ratio to highlight cost performance differences.

**Conclusion**__
This project demonstrates how statistical modeling combined with financial data can provide valuable insights into the banking industry. 
Public sector banks show stronger performance in profitability and efficiency, while asset size and sector classification are significant predictors of Net Profit. 
The study showcases the usefulness of Gamma Regression in modeling right-skewed financial variables and supports improved data-driven decision-making in the financial sector.
